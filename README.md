# breast-cancer-diagnosis

Use of TensorFlow and neural networks

Diagnosis-

Malignant (Tumor that must be removed)
Benign (Tumor that is not cancerous)

 {   1= malignant  }
 {   0= benign     }
 

- This is considered supervised machine learning because we know for a fact that the tumor is malignant or benign (given data)

- measurements describe properties of the cell's nucleus (eg, perimetr, texture, area, size)
